# Harvard CS50 SQL
This repo contains my coursework from Harvard's CS50 SQL.

The course can be followed in the [official site](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2023/).

## Installation
To follow this course, we use `SQLite`, which can be installed in MacOS using `brew`.
```
brew install sqlite
```
Start using `sqlite` with the next command. This will open the database using `sqlite3`
```
sqlite3 longlist.db
```

Exit the cli using
```
.quit
```
